                      issue another request to the endpoint that served this list
                      to retrieve the next set of available objects. Continuing a

                      field returned when using this continue value will be identical
                      to the value in the first response, unless you have received

                      the list request contained label or field selectors, then the
                      number of remaining items is unknown and the field will be left
                      unset and omitted during serialization. If the list is complete
                      (either because it is not chunking or because this is the last
                      chunk), then there are no more remaining items and this field
                      will be left unset and omitted during serialization. Servers
                      older than v1.15 do not set this field. The intended use of
                      the remainingItemCount is *estimating* the size of a collection.
                      Clients should not rely on the remainingItemCount to be set
                      or to be exact.
